For a capstone in an Emory Data Analytics boot camp, I conducted an analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to understand the impact of AMR infections on life expectancy. 
I used Python to clean and check data and then manipulated the data in Tableau to create visuals on health impacts and types of pathogen by country. 
I joined population data to assess by Years of Life Lost per capita to more clearly indicate the impact that these infections can have on a single life. 
I also narrowed down the types of pathogens to the top pathogen in each country to illustrate pathogens that should be looked into more thoroughly. I did this in both Tableau and SQL to create a chart and map.
